# Welcome! 

I've created this site for many reasons - namely, to organize my proudest projects, to document the things I learn everyday and to have fun with it along the way! I will be using it as a showcase of my work but also as a motivator for me to never stop learning and to continue being creative. Have a look around and get to know me and my skillsets
